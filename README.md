# WA-University-Crime-Data

This repository contains data from the US Department of Education campus safety and security website.  It covers a variety of different crime data for college campuses nationwide.  For purposes of analysis, I pulled data for six major universities in Washington State - University of Washington, Washington State University, Western Washington University, Gonzaga University, Seattle University, and Whitman University.  

# Motivation
Crime gets a large amount of attention these days both in the media and in our personal lives.  Seattle, home to UW and Seattle University, is known as a high-crime area that gets national attention because of this.  The Logan neighborhood, surrounding Gonzaga, is also known as a high crime area.  WSU is known as a place with heavy amounts of drinking, drug use, and partying.  Whitman is in Walla Walla, and as a small school in a quaint town seems like it would be low on crime.  I wanted to compare campus safety at each of these institutions and evauluate where each is falling short.
